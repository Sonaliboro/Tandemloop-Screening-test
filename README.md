# Tandemloop-Screening-test
Hi everyone, Sonali here!
I would like thank Tandemloop for giving me this opportunity to participate in the First screening test for the adequate position. I am very much delighted and happy 
that I got a chance to showcase my skills. As mentioned in the assignment task I had accurately created the sections of web pages and had converted them into the form of a responsive mobile layout along with I have also presented the mobile Mockup for better differntiation and better understanding. 
I hope I meet your requirements and I am looking forward to hearing back you!
Thankyou, Regards
